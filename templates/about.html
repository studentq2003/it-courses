    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class="about-container">
        <h2>What is roadmap?</h2>
        <p><b>roadmap</b> contains community-curated roadmaps, study plans, paths, and resources for developers. There
            are
            role-based roadmaps, listing skills you should know for any given role, as well as skill-based roadmaps
            listing
            items to learn for any given skill.
        </p>
        <p>
            It started as a set of visual charts on GitHub to guide developers who are confused about what they should
            learn next, but then expanded into interactive roadmaps where you can click and get resources to learn any
            given resource, contribute by adding new roadmaps, suggest changes to existing roadmaps, track your progress
            as you follow a roadmap and so on.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-container">
        <h2>How are roadmaps created?</h2>
        <p>project has a strong community that powers everything on the website. It is the 6th most starred
            opensource project on GitHub and gets visited by hundreds of thousands of developers every month. We
            also have newsletter with 150,000+ developers. All the roadmaps are created and reviewed by community
            and several subject matter experts. Also, anyone can suggest changes to any roadmap and we have a
            process to review and approve them.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-container">
        <h2>What are the plans for roadmap.sh?</h2>
        <p>Our long-term plan is to make roadmap.sh a go-to place for developers whenever they plan on learning
            something new. We started with roadmaps, guides, videos and other visual content but we plan on introducing
            best practices, best-practices for certain tasks, quizzes to test your knowledge and prepare yourself for
            the interviews, project ideas to work on while following the roadmaps, public profiles to share your
            progress and interact with the other learners and so on.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-container">
        <h2>How is roadmap.sh built??</h2>
        <p>The website is built with Astro and Tailwind and is deployed to GitHub pages. The project is fully
            open-source and the codebase can be found on GitHub
        </p>
