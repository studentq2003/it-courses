                        <p>Even if you’re a beginner the least you would have known is that Web Development is majorly
                            classified into two facets: Frontend Development and Backend Development. And obviously,
                            they
                            both have their respective set of tools and technologies. For instance, when we talk about
                            Frontend Development, there always comes 3 names first and foremost – HTML, CSS, and
                            JavaScript.

                            In the same way, when it comes to Backend Web Development – we primarily require a backend
                            (or
                            you can say server-side) programming language to make the website function along with
                            various
                            other tools & technologies such as databases, frameworks, web servers, etc.

                            Pick a language from the given list and make sure to learn its quirks, core details about
                            its
                            runtime e.g. concurrency, memory model etc.

                        <p>Python is a well known programming language which is both a strongly typed and a dynamically
                            typed
                            language. Being an interpreted language, code is executed as soon as it is written and the
                            Python
                            syntax allows for writing code in functional, procedural or object-oriented programmatic
                            ways.

                        <h2>Process Monitoring</h2>
                        <p>A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. Each process is
                            identified
                            by a unique number called a process ID (PID). A process is a running program. The operating
                            system tracks processes through the use of process identifiers. A process identifier (PID)
                            is a
                            unique number that identifies a specific process. A PID is automatically assigned to each
                            process when it is created on the system.

                            There are several linux commands that can be used to monitor processes.
                        </p>

                        <p>Cloud providers provide a layer of APIs to abstract infrastructure and provision it based on
                            security and billing boundaries. The cloud runs on servers in data centers, but the
                            abstractions
                            cleverly give the appearance of interacting with a single “platform” or large application.
                            The
                            ability to quickly provision, configure, and secure resources with cloud providers has been

                        <h2>CI/CD</h2>
                        <p>CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the
                            stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration,
                            continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is a solution to the problems
                            integrating
                            new code can cause for development and operations teams.

                            Specifically, CI/CD introduces ongoing automation and continuous monitoring throughout the
                            lifecycle of apps, from integration and testing phases to delivery and deployment. Taken
                            together, these connected practices are often referred to as a “CI/CD pipeline” and are
                            supported by development and operations teams working together in an agile way with either a
                            DevOps or site reliability engineering (SRE) approach.
